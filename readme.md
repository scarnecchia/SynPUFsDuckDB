# SAS2Parquet

This is an informal scripted designed to convert the [CMS 2008-2010 Data Entrepreneurs' Synthetic Public Use Files (SynPUFs)](https://www.sentinelinitiative.org/methods-data-tools/software-packages-toolkits/medicare-claims-synthetic-public-use-files-sentinel-0) in the Sentinel Common Data Model (SCDM) format from SAS to Parquet without requiring SAS software to export the data to an intermediate format.
